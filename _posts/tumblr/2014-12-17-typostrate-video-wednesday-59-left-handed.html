<p class="first">Left handed lettering seems to be quite impossible. That it’s not, is showing us <a href="http://www.verg.com.au" title="matt vergotis">Matt Vergotis</a>, designer, founder of verg and lettering lover from Cold Coast, Australia. His philosophy is simple but deep: “Do what you love.” He is one burning graphic designer with the attitude that the client must love what he gets from him. If he doesn’t the job is not done good. What do you think?</p>
