<p>All milk production depends on the use and abuse of reproductive systems that do not belong to us, and on the cruel sabotaging of motherhood. On all dairy farms,<a href="http://living-consciously.tumblr.com/post/96728437435/how-to-break-the-mother-calf-bond-from-a-small">organic, small, or free-range</a>, calves are traumatically separated from their mothers, usually within a few hours or days of birth. This is because, <b>like all mammals, cows only produce milk to feed their young. </b>If they don’t have babies to feed, they don’t make milk. Humans are able to consume all the milk and dairy products they want (but don’t need) only by keeping cows forcibly pregnant and lactating, then tearing away the calves for whom the milk is intended. Male calves are cruelly confined in crates or stalls and slaughtered for veal, and females calves are removed from their mothers and fed milk replacer, soon to be impregnated themselves and forced to endure the same devastating cycle of repeated birth and loss. After a few years of constant milking, dairy cows are slaughtered when their milk production declines, at only a fraction of their lifespan. <br/></p><p>I’m also opposed to dairy due to its enormous carbon footprint and water waste that it causes. </p><ul><li>It takes <a href="http://water.epa.gov/learn/kids/drinkingwater/water_trivia_facts.cfm#_edn11">1000 gallons of water are required to produce 1 gallon of milk</a>.</li><li>A farm with 2,500 dairy cows produces the same amount of waste as a city of 411,000 people.</li></ul><p>We do not need animal protein whatsoever. Dairy and meat is hurting this planet and the animals as well.</p>
