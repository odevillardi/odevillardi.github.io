22-year-old industrial design student Nick Pourfard, who recently

 brand. <br/></p><p>Pourfard, who’s also a proficient, self-taught woodworker, takes
 used and battered skate decks and upcycles them into eye-catching,
multicolored electric guitars, thus melding his love for both
skateboarding and music.</p></blockquote><p>(via <a href="http://hypebeast.com/2015/7/designer-nick-pourfard-recycles-skate-decks-into-colorful-guitars">Designer Nick Pourfard Upcycles Skate Decks Into Colorful Guitars | HYPEBEAST</a>) <br/></p><p><i><a href="https://twitter.com/dstitch">— d.n.</a></i><br/></p></blockquote>
