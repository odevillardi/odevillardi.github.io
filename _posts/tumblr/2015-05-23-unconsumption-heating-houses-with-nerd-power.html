<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-32816775">Heating houses with ‘nerd power’ - BBC News</a>:<br/></p><blockquote><p><b>All computers produce heat, but
computer servers produce a lot of heat - so much that it usually costs a
 fortune to cool them down. <br/></b></p><p><b>So why isn’t this heat used instead to keep
homes or offices warm? Actually, “nerd power” is already being tried
out.</b></p><p>Ask Jerry van Waardhuizen about his new radiator and you get
an excited response. “I’m very enthusiastic,” he says. “It’s a beautiful
 thing.” The sleek white box, which has been hugging his wall for two
weeks, looks nice enough as radiators go. But what’s really got
Waardhuizen excited is what’s going on inside. </p><p>Instead of hot
water, it contains a computer connected to the internet, doing big sums
and kicking out heat in the process. It was created by a Dutch start-up
called Nerdalize, and could be part of a solution to a big problem for
the tech industry.</p></blockquote><p>Read more <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-32816775">here</a>. </p><p><i><a href="http://robwalker.net/">— rw</a><br/><br/>Got a tip for Unconsumption? Submit it <a href="http://unconsumption.tumblr.com/submit">here</a>! </i><br/></p></blockquote>
