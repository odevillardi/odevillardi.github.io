<h2>The Story of a Spoon</h2><blockquote><p>The Story of a Spoon charts the story of a plastic spoon, from the Big
Bang to the Bin Bag, and aims to raise awareness of the effects of
over-consumption in our society. This video is an appeal for people to
take a moment to think about how the stuff we buy came into existence,
and what happens to that stuff when we no longer have use for it.</p><p>For more information, please visit <a title="http://grnpc.org/Ig2UM" href="http://grnpc.org/Ig2UM">http://grnpc.org/Ig2UM</a></p></blockquote><p>Absurde voyage autour du monde&hellip;<br/></p>
