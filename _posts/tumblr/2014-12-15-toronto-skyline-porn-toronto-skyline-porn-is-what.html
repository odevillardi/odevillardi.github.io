<h2>Toronto Skyline Porn</h2>
<p class="first">Toronto Skyline Porn is what its title implies &ndash; a full frontal visual journey through Toronto&rsquo;s growing skyline. The scenes were shot over the past few years from different heights and in different seasons. </p>
<p>Ive enjoyed showcasing Toronto in the past in a more warmhearted tone but with the evolution of the city over the last 4 years I figured a skyline short was fitting.</p>
<p>I used a modified GoPro on a DJI Phantom 2 for the aerial shots. All other scenes were captured with a Canon 5DM3.</p>
