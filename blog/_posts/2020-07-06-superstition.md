> Groove is one of the most underrated aspects of modern music, at least from a music theory perspective. The way a good funk groove layers lots of different rhythms with different lengths and different layers of complexity in order to form one towering, cohesive whole is amazing, and few artists understood how to do that half as well as Stevie Wonder. He's put out so many hits it's hard to know where to start, but Superstition is one of the most impressive feats of groove ever recorded, so I wanted to take it apart, piece by piece, and really understand how exactly it all works together!
